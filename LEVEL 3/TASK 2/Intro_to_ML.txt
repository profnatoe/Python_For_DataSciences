One particular trend in AI that interest me is AI-Based Virtual Assistant Technology.

This technology intends to replace some of the day-to-day functions and responsibilities of people.
They decrease the time you have to spend on mundane tasks in order to allow you to free up your time
to do more interesting, strategic and hopefully impactful things.

For example you can ask your Virtual Assistant to schedule a meeting for you,
to remind you of all your meetings everyday. Some virtual Assistant can do other complex things like
reading books to your children, suggesting which hotels to go to,ect.

Examples are as follows: Siri, Alexa, Cortana, Jarvis and others. 
We use this technology in our phones, some use it in their homes as part of smart homes bundle and connect it to IoT
so that you can just ask it to switch off devices in the house, change temperature of the room,etc.
