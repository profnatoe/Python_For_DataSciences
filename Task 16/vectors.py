# Part 1: Vector and Complex Numbers
# ========================

# In this exercise you will use what you have learned to implement a Vector
# class and a complex number class.

# ========================
# The Vector class
# ========================

# Write definitions for a class called Vector.
# Your definition should include a constructor,  __str__, values for the x and y
# coordinates, and methods for addition and subtraction of vectors, scalar multiplication,
# length, and comparison.
