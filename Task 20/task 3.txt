# What is Amazon Comprehend Medical

-It is a technology that uses pretrained NLP model to analyze unstructured clinical text through entity detection.
-An entity is a textual reference to medical information such as medical conditions, medications, or protected health information.
-Some operations go one step further by detecting entities and then linking those entities to standardized ontologies.
 The model is continuously trained on a large body of medical texts, so you don't need to provide training data. All results include a confidence score, 
 which indicates the confidence that Amazon Comprehend Medical has in the accuracy of the detected entities
