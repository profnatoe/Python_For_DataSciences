
1. Heat map

A heat map or choropleth map is a data visualisation that shows the relationship between two measures and provides rating information.
The rating information is displayed using varying colors or saturatuib and can exhibit ratings such as high to low or bad to awesome, and needs improvement to working well.

It can also be a thematic map in which the area inside recognized boundaries is shared in proportion to the data being represented.

heat map  is good for discrete data because we can perform the following:

- to show a relationship between two measures
- to illustrate an important detail
- to use a rating system

2. Treemap

A Treemap is a visual tool that can be used to break down the relationship between multiple variables in your data. 
They can be used strictly as a presentation vehicle to show how your products roll up into different categories, for example a treemap can be broken down
into 2-3 different layers to show the hierachical relationship between items.

A treemap is good for hierachical data because usually a hierachical data comes in large amount and a treemap charts are equiped to be able to plot more than tens of thousands of data points.

3. Waterfall chart

A Waterfall chart is an information visualisation that should be used to show how an initial value
is affected by intermediate values and resulted in a final value.
The values can either be negative or positive

- Waterfall chart is good for numerical data becasue we can do the following:
  *reveal the composition or makeup of a number.



#COMPULSORY TASK 2

- Visualisation A
    * Display pie chart key on the right side - It is best to know more about the data. for example how the calculations were done
    * All slices should add up to 100%, this should be displayed. - We don't know anything about the items that are presented here. Each slice's percentage
      must be displayed.
    * Display Pie Chart Heading and with a bigger or bold font because we don't know what the data is for.
      A heading will improve the data visualisation because one would know what the visualisation is all about.

- Visualisation B 
    * Place the x-axis label below the graph because its current position makes it to look like it is the heading of the graph.
    * Have a proper Heading - Describing what is happening in the graph by using a header helps to understand what is going on.
    * Use horizontal label on the x-axis => It is difficult to read the labels for each bar on the x-axis. writting them in a horizontal form can improve the visualization 
-Visualisation C
    *The order of the colors must be consistent throughout - This is because it can be frastrating if red is at the bottom from the first column and placed somewhere on other columns
    *Place x-axis label below the chart not on top - a reader of the chart can be confuse the x-axis label for a chart heading. In this case we don't understand if the label at the top is a heading or x-axis label
    *Value annotations - It is difficult to know the value of the bars. an annotation will better the visualization because we can compare sub-bar sizes
