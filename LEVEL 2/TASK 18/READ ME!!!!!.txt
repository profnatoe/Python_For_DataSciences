Since you are going to present this to your mentor i will let you do most of the work so that you are atleast familiar with EDA

* Look at the following tasks to help you understand better what is required:

 	- Task 15 notebook
	- Task 16 and 17

If there's a plot that you need me to do to answer specific question that you have in mind please let me know i will add it.

Good Luck!
