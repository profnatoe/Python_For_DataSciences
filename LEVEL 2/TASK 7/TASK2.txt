For dataset number 1: 

I would use a pie chart. Reason being that a pie chart illustrates
the proportion of the quantity it represents. There are different categories 
there especially looking at the scores given: english, science and maths.
Different colors can be used to differentiate these categories.

For the second dataset:

I would use a bar chart. we would be able to show side-by-side comparisons of the categories 
i.e  we would be able to see the income of individuals based on their gender and also look at the age categories.
